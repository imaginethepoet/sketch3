A collection of my sketch 3 plugins, and files

IPHONE PORTRAIT LAUNCH IMAGES XCODE 7.1
One of the most frustrating things is coming up with the launch screens for iphone apps. This is
a simple sketch file with artboards set the right size

1. Place your art in the BG Layer 
2. You will need to duplicate your art to each board and adjust accordingly (I recommend set your
art as grouped content and then just paste across each artboard.
3. File Export to save the slices.
4. Drag your exported images into your newly created LaunchImage Catalog in IOS
